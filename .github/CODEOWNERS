## GitHub Review Policy

- **Minimum approvals required:** 1
- **Stale review timeout:** 1 day (reset on new commits)
- **Auto-dismiss stale reviews:** Enabled
- **Require code owner review:** For files in this CODEOWNERS list
- **Allow auto-merge:** Yes (after all checks pass)

## Code Owner Responsibilities

1. **Code Quality:** Ensure changes meet ruff/mypy standards
2. **Testing:** Verify pytest passes with adequate coverage
3. **Documentation:** Check docs are updated for user-facing changes
4. **Governance:** Enforce CODEOWNERS, branch protection, security policies
5. **Backwards Compatibility:** Review for breaking changes (document if necessary)
6. **Performance:** Assess impact on runtime performance, resource usage
7. **Security:** Verify no credentials/secrets are committed

## Review Timeline

| Type | Timeline | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Documentation only | 24 hours | Fast track |
| Feature | 48 hours | Requires full testing |
| Security fix | 24 hours | Expedited |
| Dependency update | 24 hours | Requires audit report |

## Exception Process

To bypass code owner review (NOT recommended):
1. Open an issue explaining why bypass is necessary
2. Get explicit approval from all code owners
3. Document rationale in PR description
4. Add "force-merge" label only with maintainer consensus

## Escalation

For disagreements on code review decisions:
1. Discuss in PR comments (3 business days)
2. Involve additional code owner if needed
3. If unresolved, escalate to project lead
