# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. We pledge that everyone participating in our community will be treated with respect, regardless of levels of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Helping others learn and improve

### Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment of any kind (including comments, images, or behavior of a sexual nature)
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person

## Enforcement

### Consequences for Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community.

### Reporting

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a project maintainer immediately at [maintainer-email]@example.com.

All reports will be handled with discretion. Retaliation is never acceptable and will be taken seriously.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies:
- Within project spaces (GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions)
- In public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community
- In interactions that occur outside formal project spaces if they impact the safety or well-being of community members

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.
